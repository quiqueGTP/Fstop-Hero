Fstop Hero
A tiny arcade game where you battle blur with… math (shhh, don’t tell the students).

Tap your way through the classic f-stop scale, one third-stop at a time. Every round shows two choices: one real f-number and one sneaky imposter. Beat the clock, save your 3 hearts, and climb from f/1 to f/64 to become the aperture legend.

Highlights:

37 sequential rounds (1/3-stop steps, f/1 → f/64)

4 modes: Learn (no timer), Easy (6s), Medium (4s), Hard (2s)

Speed scoring: <1s = +10 · 1–2s = +5 · ≥2s = +3

Smart decoys that look almost right (because we’re mean but fair)

3 lives, crunchy SFX, countdown, and a clean end screen showing only the stops you missed

Perfect for classrooms, photo clubs, or anyone who’s ever asked, “Wait… is f/5.6 brighter than f/8?”
